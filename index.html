        <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Is there a sight more iconic, more beautiful, more jaw-droppingly spectacular than the Taj Mahal? ś</h3><BR><br>
        
            <p>Quite honestly, we can’t think of one.</p><br><br>
        
            <p> At the very least, there’s no mausoleum more grand, no declaration of love more apparent than</p>
           <p> building a marble masterpiece for one’s favorite wife… And no better reason to travel than seeing </p>
           <p>its magnificence up close.</p><br><br>

            <p> After all, this is art. Built in Agra,<span><a href="#" style="color: rgba(175, 7, 7, 0.788);">INDIA</a></span> between 1631 and 1648, it’s also history. And, of course, it’s</p>
            <p>the perfect opportunity to take some otherworldly photos. So, to help visitors prepare for their Taj </p>
            <p>Mahal travels, we’ve prepared a little guide, enlisting the help of some Intrepid experts – from</p>
            <p> Destination Managers to acclaimed trip leaders – to cover all the bases.
        </p><br><br>
            <p>Coming up: what to bring, where to take the best snaps, what else to see in Agra (and beyond),</p>
            <p>and so much more…</p><br><br>
            <h2>Before you arrive at the Taj Maha</h2><br><br>
            <p>That old saying ‘patience is a virtue’ really comes into its own when discussing the Taj Mahal.</p><br><br>
            <p>Be prepared to be surrounded by hundreds (if not thousands) of people. These include Indian</p>
            <p>men, women and children who may ask to take photos with you.</p><br><br>
            <p>To prepare with the help of other travelers and a local tour guide, consider taking a group tour.</p>
            <p>Intrepid have Taj-visiting trips that range from<span> <a href="#" style="color: brown; text-decoration: underline;">8-day Golden Triangle tours</a></span> (now with<span> <a href="#" style="color: brown; text-decoration: underline;"> solo-only</a></span></p>

           <p>The entrance queue can be pretty long during peak season but as long as you’re mentally</p>
           <p>prepared, you’ll be fine. What’s to come is more than worth the wait…</p><br>
           <h2>What to bring to the Taj Mahal</h2><br>
           <p>Always leave your valuables in the hotel. There are lockers available at the Taj but it’s best to have</p>
           <p>minimal belongings on you so you don’t spend too much time checking in.</p><br>
           <p>You really only need to bring the following in one small bag:</p><br><BR>
          <DIV class="LISTTAG"> <ul>
            <li>Passport</li>&nbsp;
            <LI>Money</LI>&nbsp;
            <LI>Water</LI>&nbsp;
            <LI>Medicine</LI>&nbsp;
            <LI>Camera</LI>&nbsp;
            <LI>Phone</LI>&nbsp;
           </ul></DIV><br>
           <h2>What to wear to the Taj Mahal</h2><br>
           <p>There is no dress code but you should still be respectful. If you want to enter the mosque, you will</p>
           <p>need to cover your head, shoulders and knees</p><br>
           <p>It gets hot in Agra and there is very little shade, so wear light clothing and make sure you wear</p>
           <p>sunscreen. Then again, Agra also gets very cold in winter (Nov-Feb) so layers are your friend too.</p><br>
           <p>If you visit with Intrepid, you’ll be taken there earlier in the day or later in the afternoon to avoid</p>
           <p>the worst of the heat.</p><br>
           <div class="img4"><img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/India_Agra_taj_mahal_sunset_210.jpg"></div><br>
           <p>Useful tip from Ryan Turner, Intrepid’s Destination Manager for India:</p>
           <div class="double"><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTyJFKqSmYZ_DROz8PaizLtf8ws6dXqjHaWPg&s" alt="double" height="20px" width="20px">
            <p>Having been to the Taj a few times, I’ve learnt the importance of wearing shoes that are</p>
            <p>easy to remove. You need to take your shoes off when you go inside and the easier they are</p>
            <P>to slip on and off the better. This actually applies to much of India – shoes with loads of</P>  
            <P>laces are hard!</P>
            </div><br>
            <h2>Other things you need to know</h2><br>
            <p>No food is allowed inside.</p><br>
            <p>Cigarettes and lighters are also not allowed</p><br>
            <p>Tripods and additional lighting equipment need prior permission to be brought with.</p>
            <p>Photography inside the mausoleum is prohibited. Most electronics (except cameras and small</p>
            <p>video cameras) are not allowed</p><br>
            <p>Be wary of touts, thieves and rude shop keepers. It’s a busy, high-pressure area, but keep your</p>
            <p>wits about you and you won’t need to worry</p><br>
            <h1>When you’re at the Taj Mahal</h1><br>
            <p>Go early, wait for space to explore and photograph, and get yourself away from the crowds (if</p>
            <p>possible).</p><br>
            <div class="img5"><img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/India_Agra_taj_mahal_crowds_185.jpg"></div><br>
            <p>If you walk around to the right side of the Taj (as you approach the east gate), you can get an</p>
            <p>amazing photo from the riverbank behind the Taj. (Always go in groups and get a rickshaw to</p>
            <p>take you there and back cheaply.)</p>
            ]<p>And simply focus on taking in all the magic. Even Intrepid leaders who see the Taj Mahal monthly</p>
            <p>(or more!) remain in awe of it.<span > <a href="#" style="color: brown ;text-decoration: underline;"> Sana Jinah,</a></span> one of the company’s inspiring female tour guides, has</p>
            <p>some tips on how to do this:</p>
            <div class="img6"><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTyJFKqSmYZ_DROz8PaizLtf8ws6dXqjHaWPg&s" alt="double" height="20px" width="20px">
            <p>The Taj Mahal is a place for exploring quietly on your own or with loved ones. So, once I’m</p>
            <p>done briefing my groups I give them a good 2-3 hours inside the Taj. There are ways I try to</p>
            <p>make the experience special and memorable for travelers, but if I say what they are then</p>
            <p>they will no longer be surprises!</p>
            <p>The Taj has such a charm. Every time I see it it looks different (due to the direction of the</p>
            <p>sunlight). It’s so beautiful…</p>
            </div><br>
            <p>She also recommends those looking for optimum conditions try visiting the Taj Mahal at sunrise</p>
            <p>on a clear day.</p><br>
            <h1>Tips for taking photos at the Taj Mahal</h1><br>
            <p>Everyone wants that iconic shot of themselves at the Taj Mahal. You know the one – where you sit</p>
            <p>on the bench and the grandeur of the marble mausoleum forms the backdrop</p><br>
            <div class="img7"><img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/india_agra_taj-mahal_taking-in-the-surroundings.jpg"></div><br>
            <p>But if you’re feeling creative and want to mix things up, there are tons of different angles worth</p>
            <p>seeking out</p><br>
            <p>Below are some photography suggestions from Intrepid’s General Manager in India, <span> <a href="#">Pravin</a></span></p>
            <p><span><a href="#">Tamang.</a></span> (His photography is amazing –<span><a href="#"> check it outs</a></span>!)</p><br>

                <li>Shot from the arch of the main doorway</li>
                <li>Capture the reflection of the fountains that line the route towards the Taj Mahal’s main platform</li>

                <li>Shot of Taj Mahal from the riverside with the reflection on the river</li>
                <li>Shot from the other side of the river, ‘Mehtab Bagh’, where you get a glimpse of Taj</li>
                <li>The Taj Mahal can also be shot from some parts of the Red Fort</li>
            </ul>
            ]<p>You can also get great photos from the many rooftops of restaurants close to the Taj Mahal.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, Agra does get pretty smoggy, so winter can often have poor visibility earlier in the</p>
            <p>day and around sunset. That said, this can make shots look very atmospheric!</p><br>

            ]<h2>What to do after visiting the Taj Mahal</h2>
            ]<p>First, go back to your hotel room, take a shower, and revel in the relative peace and quiet. Then</p>
            <p>explore these cool destinations both in and out of Agra:</p><br>
            <h3>What to do in Agra</h3><br>
            <p>The Taj Mahal is, quite clearly, the star of the show in this northern Indian city. But the Agra Fort is</p>
            <p>also stunning, especially if you didn’t get a chance to go to the Red Fort in Delhi. A 16th-century</p>
            <p>Mughal monument and UNESCO World Heritage site, it’s a sight not to be missed.</p><br>
            <p>Despite being located on the<span><a href="#"> Golden Triangle</a></span> tourist circuit, there’s less to do in Agra than in</p>
            <p>many other Indian cities. It’s pretty polluted from the heavy industry (more on that later) and you </p>
            <p>likely won’t spend too long there, whatever the trip.</p><br>
            <p>One way that Intrepid tries to show visitors a different perspective on the country is by</p>
            <p>(sometimes) taking travelers to <span><a href="#">Sheroes Hangout</a></span>. Just blocks from the Taj Mahal, it’s a small cafe</p>
            <p>run entirely by female acid attack survivors. Here, victims of attacks are employed and tell their</p>
            <p>stories. It can be confronting, but also inspiring and memorable in equal measures.</p><br>

            <h3>Where to go outside of Agra</h3><br>
            <p class="para2">There are various great destinations only a few hours drive (well, 4-7) from the Taj Mahal. Of these,
                 Orchha, Jaipur and Pushkar are all tourist-friendly, peaceful and beautiful places.</p>
             <p class="para3">Orchha is a town that travelers often overlook. This is a shame, because it’s historic, laid-back
                 and has a bunch of beautiful temples. It’s not always on tour itineraries, but you CAN visit
                  it on <span ><a href="#">15-day trip</a></span> from <span ><a href="#">Delhi to Kathmandu</a></span> (cooking demo and palace visit included!).</p>    
              <div class="img9"><img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/india_orchha_temple.jpg" ></div>
              <P class="imgcenter">Chaturbhuj Temple in Orchha</P> 
              <p class="para4">Jaipur is much more well-known. Also known as the <span><a href="#">‘Pink City’</a></span>, the capital of Rajasthan is full of 
                chaos, charm and unique architecture. Visit the hilltop Amber Fort, haggle in the enchanting 
                bazaars, and consider taking a hot air balloon over the city to take it all in.<br><br>

                Pushkar is another underrated town. One of the oldest and most serene towns in India, it’s home 
                to Pushkar Lake, a sacred spot for Hindus that’s utterly dazzling at sundown. Because of its holy
                 nature, the vegetarian food here is simply unmissable. Visit on this <span><a href="#">15-day trip</a></span> all around 
                 Rajasthan.<br><br>
                 <h2>A final note about the Taj Mahal’s mud therapy</h2><br><br>
                 <p class="para5">As you may have<span><a href="#">read</a></span> or heard, the Taj Mahal has recently been undergoing a very thorough
                  clean. Yep, to be precise, a mud mask as of April 2018.<br><br>
                  Why? Air pollution from factories in Agra had been slowly turning the Taj Mahal’s ivory-white
                   surfaces yellow – and this was one way of restoring them to their former glory. The work – 
                   applying a clay traditionally used to clean marble to the entire structure of the Taj – was carried
                   out by the Archaeological Survey of India. And this work was part of a series of restorative projects
                   carried out on the historic site.
